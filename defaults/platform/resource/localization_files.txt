// list files that you want the game to read in for localization
// the game will automatically append _LANGUAGE.txt to whatever you list here
// so, for example, for the entry 'r1', if you launch the game in english, the game will automatically try and load r1_english.txt
// if you add a new localization file, please make sure that the encoding for that file is "UTF-16 LE with BOM"
